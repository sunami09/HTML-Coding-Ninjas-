<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <title> Coding Ninjas </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to Coding Ninjas ! </h1>

- <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the file being displayed is HTML5 page.
- <html> meant to contain all the HTML data and is the start of an HTML document.
- <head> provides information about the document. It is not displayed in the browser window.
- <title> provides a title for the document.
- <body> contains everything visible on the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- <h1> element defines a large heading.
- <p> element defines a paragraph.
```

**Questions**
- What can be the possible extension for the HTML5 file?
- What is the correct syntax for writing ‘doctype’ in HTML5?
- What is the function of the title tags?
